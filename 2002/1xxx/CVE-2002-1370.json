Reason: This CAN was originally assigned for the theft of root certificates in CUPS, but it was later deemed to be a legitimate result of exploiting a different vulnerability, CVE-2002-1367, so it is not a distinct vulnerability.  Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2002-1367 instead of this candidate.  All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage."
