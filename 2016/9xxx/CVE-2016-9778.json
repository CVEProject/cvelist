Redirection using zones of type \"redirect\" is not affected by this vulnerability. Affects BIND 9.9.8-S1 -> 9.9.8-S3, 9.9.9-S1 -> 9.9.9-S6, 9.11.0-9.11.0-P1."

In order to be affected a server must be using nxdomain-redirect AND must be redirecting NXDOMAIN responses for a zone for which the server also provides authoritative service -- therefore a purely recursive server is not at risk, either.  Successful exploitation of the vulnerability will cause named to stop execution after encountering a REQUIRE assertion failure in db.c, resulting in denial of service to clients."
