Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Oracle JDeveloper executes to compromise Oracle JDeveloper. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle JDeveloper, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle JDeveloper accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle JDeveloper accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle JDeveloper.
