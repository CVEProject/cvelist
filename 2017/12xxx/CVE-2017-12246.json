The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the HTTP header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the local IP address of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload. This vulnerability affects Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software that is running on the following Cisco products: ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls, ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv), Firepower 4110 Security Appliance, Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module, ISA 3000 Industrial Security Appliance.
