                "value": "A vulnerability in 802.11 association request frame processing for the Cisco Aironet 1560, 2800, and 3800 Series Access Points could allow an unauthenticated, Layer 2 radio frequency (RF) adjacent attacker to cause the Access Point (AP) to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient frame validation of the 802.11 association request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed 802.11 association request to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the AP to reload, resulting in a DoS condition while the AP is reloading. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products running either the Lightweight AP Software or Mobility Express image: Aironet 1560 Series Access Points, Aironet 2800 Series Access Points, Aironet 3800 Series Access Points. Note: The Cisco Aironet 1560 Series Access Point device is supported as of release 8.3.112.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve12189."
