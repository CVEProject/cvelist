The vulnerability is triggered by an H.264 frame that has an invalid picture parameter set (PPS) value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed H.264 frame to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition because the media process could restart. The media session should be re-established within a few seconds, during which there could be a brief interruption in service. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg12559."
