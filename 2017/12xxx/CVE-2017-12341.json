An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to perform this exploit. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during the installation of a software patch. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a crafted patch image with the vulnerable operation occurring prior to patch activation. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected system as root. This vulnerability affects the following products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 5000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Unified Computing System Manager.
