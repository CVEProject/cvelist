An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain information to conduct additional attacks. The vulnerability is due to the way Cisco Jabber for Windows handles random number generation for file folders. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by fixing the random number data used to establish Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections between clients. An exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt secure communications made by the Cisco Jabber for Windows client. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve44806."
