When an external applicant registers to the E-Recruiting application, he/she receives a link by email to confirm access to the provided email address. However, this measure can be bypassed and attackers can register and confirm email addresses that they do not have access to (candidate_hrobject is predictable and corr_act_guid is improperly validated). Furthermore, since an email address can be registered only once, an attacker could prevent other legitimate users from registering. This is SAP Security Note 2507798."
