This issue is due to untrusted pointer dereference in the JavaScript API engine. In this scenario, the JavaScript input is crafted in way that the computation results with pointer to memory locations that do not belong to the relevant process address space. The dereferencing operation is a read operation, and an attack can result with sensitive data exposure."
