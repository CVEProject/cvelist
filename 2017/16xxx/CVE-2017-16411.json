This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer; the computation is part of the WebCapture module, related to an internal hash table implementation. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure."
