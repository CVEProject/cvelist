While in this state, named repeatedly queries the same sets of authoritative nameservers and this behavior will usually persist indefinitely beyond the normal client query processing timeout. By triggering this condition multiple times, an attacker could cause a deliberate and substantial degradation in service.\n\nOperators of servers that meet the above conditions 1. and 2. may also accidentally encounter this defect during normal operation.
