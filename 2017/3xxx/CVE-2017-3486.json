Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged attacker having Local Logon privilege with logon to the infrastructure where SQL*Plus executes to compromise SQL*Plus. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in SQL*Plus, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of SQL*Plus. Note: This score is for Windows platform version 11.2.0.4 of Database. For Windows platform version 12.1.0.2 and Linux, the score is 6.3 with scope Unchanged. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.2 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts).
