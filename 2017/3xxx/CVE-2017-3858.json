The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of HTTP parameters supplied by the user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and submitting crafted input to the affected web page parameter. The user must be authenticated to access the affected parameter. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1, if the HTTP Server feature is enabled for the device. The newly redesigned, web-based administration interface was introduced in the Denali 16.2 Release of Cisco IOS XE Software. The web-based administration interface in earlier releases of Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuy83069."
