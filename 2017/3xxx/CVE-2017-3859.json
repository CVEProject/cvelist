The vulnerability is due to a format string vulnerability when processing a crafted DHCP packet for Zero Touch Provisioning. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted DHCP packet to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 920 Series Aggregation Services Routers that are running an affected release of Cisco IOS XE Software (3.13 through 3.18) and are listening on the DHCP server port. By default, the devices do not listen on the DHCP server port. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuy56385."
