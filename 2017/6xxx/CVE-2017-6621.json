The attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of sensitive data when responding to an HTTP request on the web interface. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the application to access specific system files. An exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about the application which could include user credentials. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software Releases 10.6 through 11.5. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc99626."
