The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not sufficiently protect sensitive data when responding to HTTP requests that are sent to the web interface of the software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web interface of the software on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information about the software. The attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.
