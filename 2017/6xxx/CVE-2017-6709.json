The vulnerability exists because the affected software logs administrative credentials in clear text for Cisco ESC and Cisco OpenStack deployment purposes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the AutoVNF URL for the location where the log files are stored and subsequently accessing the administrative credentials that are stored in clear text in those log files. This vulnerability affects all releases of the Cisco Ultra Services Framework prior to Releases 5.0.3 and 5.1. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc76659."
