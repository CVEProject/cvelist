The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization of user-supplied input at the CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a script on the device that will allow them to bypass built-in restrictions. An exploit could allow the unauthorized user to launch the CLI directly from a command shell. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd47722. Known Affected Releases: 21.0.v0.65839."
