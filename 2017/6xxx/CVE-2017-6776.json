The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to access a malicious link or by intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code into the request. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd76324. Known Affected Releases: 2.2(9.76) and 2.3(1)."
