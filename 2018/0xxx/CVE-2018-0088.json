This could result in arbitrary code execution or a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker has to have valid user credentials at privilege level 15. The vulnerability is due to a diagnostic test CLI command that allows the attacker to write to the device memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and issuing a specific diagnostic test command at the CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite system memory locations, which could have a negative impact on the stability of the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf71150."
