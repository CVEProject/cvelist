The attacker has to have a valid user credential with at least a privilege level of a guest user. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect networking configuration at the administrative shell CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and issuing a set of crafted, malicious commands at the administrative shell. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain root access on the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb34303, CSCvb35726."
