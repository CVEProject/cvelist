The vulnerability is due to improper configuration of the support tunnel feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking the device into unlocking the support user account and accessing the tunnel password and device serial number. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run any system command with root access. This affects Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) software versions prior to 2.2.0.470.
