                "value": "A vulnerability in the configuration and monitoring service of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incomplete bounds checks for data that is provided by the configuration and monitoring service of the affected solution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious data to the vDaemon listening service on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the affected device, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the device or cause the vDaemon listening service to reload and result in a DoS condition on the device. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0: vBond Orchestrator Software, vEdge 100 Series Routers, vEdge 1000 Series Routers, vEdge 2000 Series Routers, vEdge 5000 Series Routers, vEdge Cloud Router Platform, vManage Network Management Software, vSmart Controller Software.
