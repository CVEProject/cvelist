The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of data parameters for certain fields in the affected solution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a malicious username on the login page of the affected solution. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands with vmanage user privileges on an affected system. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0: vBond Orchestrator Software, vEdge 100 Series Routers, vEdge 1000 Series Routers, vEdge 2000 Series Routers, vEdge 5000 Series Routers, vEdge Cloud Router Platform, vManage Network Management Software, vSmart Controller Software.
