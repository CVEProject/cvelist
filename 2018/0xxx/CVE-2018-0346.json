                "value": "A vulnerability in the Zero Touch Provisioning service of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checks for certain values in packets that are sent to the Zero Touch Provisioning service of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to the affected software for processing. When the software processes the packets, a buffer overflow condition could occur and cause an affected device to reload. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a temporary DoS condition while the device reloads. This vulnerability can be exploited only by traffic that is destined for an affected device. It cannot be exploited by traffic that is transiting a device. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0: vBond Orchestrator Software, vManage Network Management Software, vSmart Controller Software. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi69914."
