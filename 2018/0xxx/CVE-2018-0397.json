The vulnerability exists if the affected software is running in Block network conviction mode. Exploitation could occur if the system that is running the affected software starts a server process and an address in the IP blacklist cache of the affected software attempts to connect to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a kernel panic on the system that is running the affected software, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvk08192."
