Reason: This candidate is effectively a reservation duplicate of CVE-2015-1142857, originally it was thought that an incomplete fix occured and a second CVE was needed, however this does not appear to be the case. Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2015-1142857 instead of this candidate. All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage."
