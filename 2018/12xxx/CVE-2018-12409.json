For customers that might not be able to update the software as quickly as needed, an alternate remediation is to disable the affected component. The component can be disabled by removing the configuration lines that activate it.\n\nTo disable the affected component:\n  - find the file $SF_HOME/webapps/livecluster/WEB-INF/web.xml (where\n    $SF_HOME corresponds to the root folder where TIBCO Silver Fabric is\n    installed.)\n  - open the file in a text editor, and remove the lines that look like this:\n\n  <servlet-mapping>\n    <servlet-name>AxisServlet</servlet-name>\n    <url-pattern>/webservices/*</url-pattern>\n  </servlet-mapping>\n  <servlet-mapping>\n    <servlet-name>AxisServlet</servlet-name>\n    <url-pattern>/WebServices/*</url-pattern>\n  </servlet-mapping>\n"
