Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Oracle Data Visualization Desktop executes to compromise Oracle Data Visualization Desktop. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Data Visualization Desktop, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Oracle Data Visualization Desktop accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Data Visualization Desktop accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Data Visualization Desktop.
