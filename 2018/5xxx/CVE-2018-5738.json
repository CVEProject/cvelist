The intended (and documented) behavior is that if an operator has not specified a value for the \"allow-recursion\" setting, it SHOULD default to one of the following: none, if \"recursion no;\" is set in named.conf; a value inherited from the \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" settings IF \"recursion yes;\" (the default for that setting) AND match lists are explicitly set for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" (see the BIND9 Administrative Reference Manual section 6.2 for more details); or the intended default of \"allow-recursion {localhost; localnets;};\" if \"recursion yes;\" is in effect and no values are explicitly set for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\". However, because of the regression introduced by change #4777, it is possible when \"recursion yes;\" is in effect and no match list values are provided for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" for the setting of \"allow-recursion\" to inherit a setting of all hosts from the \"allow-query\" setting default, improperly permitting recursion to all clients. Affects BIND 9.9.12, 9.10.7, 9.11.3, 9.12.0->9.12.1-P2, the development release 9.13.0, and also releases 9.9.12-S1, 9.10.7-S1, 9.11.3-S1, and 9.11.3-S2 from BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition."

If a value is set for any of those values the behavior of allow-recursion will be set directly or inherited from one of the other values as described in the BIND Adminstrator Reference Manual section 6.2.\n\nServers which are not intended to perform recursion at all may also effectively prevent this condition by setting \"recursion no;\" in named.conf."
