However, if successfully exercised, the defect will cause named to deliberately exit after encountering an assertion failure.\n\nIt is more likely, perhaps, that this bug could be encountered accidentally, as not all versions of BIND support the same set of cryptographic algorithms. Specifically, recent branches of BIND have begun deliberately removing support for cryptographic algorithms that are now deprecated (for example because they are no longer considered sufficiently secure.) This vulnerability could be encountered if a resolver running a version of BIND which has removed support for deprecated algorithms is configured to use a trust anchor which elects to change algorithm types to one of those deprecated algorithms.\n\n    Support for GOST was removed from BIND in 9.13.1.\n    Support for DSA was removed from BIND in 9.13.4\n    Support for RSAMD5 will be removed from future BIND releases in the 9.13 branch and higher.\n"
