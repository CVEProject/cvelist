You should update to 8.4.8 immediately, then update to 8.5.3 or the latest secure release as soon as possible.)\nIf you are unable to update immediately, or if you are running a Drupal distribution that does not yet include this security release, you can attempt to apply the patch below to fix the vulnerability until you are able to update completely:\n\nPatch for Drupal 8.x (8.5.x and below)\nPatch for Drupal 7.x\nThese patches will only work if your site already has the fix from SA-CORE-2018-002 applied.
