The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly parses certain options in OSPF link-state advertisement (LSA) type 11 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LSA type 11 OSPF packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition for client traffic that is traversing the device."
