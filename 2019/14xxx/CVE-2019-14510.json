When using the default configuration, the LAN Cache feature creates a local account FSAdminxxxxxxxxx (e.g., FSAdmin123456789) on the server that hosts the LAN Cache and all clients that are assigned to a LAN Cache. This account is placed into the local Administrators group of all clients assigned to the LAN Cache. When the assigned client is a Domain Controller, the FSAdminxxxxxxxxx account is created as a domain account and automatically added as a member of the domain BUILTIN\\Administrators group. Using the well known Pass-the-Hash techniques, an attacker can use the same FSAdminxxxxxxxxx hash from any LAN Cache client and pass this to a Domain Controller, providing administrative rights to the attacker on any Domain Controller. (Local account Pass-the-Hash mitigations do not protect domain accounts.)"
