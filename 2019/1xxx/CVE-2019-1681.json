The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input within TFTP requests processed by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques in malicious requests sent to the TFTP service on a targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the targeted device, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information. This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XR Software releases prior to Release 6.5.2 for Cisco Network Convergence System 1000 Series devices when the TFTP service is enabled."
