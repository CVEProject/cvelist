The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of input Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by altering the SIP replies that are sent to the affected phone during the registration process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the phone to reboot and not complete the registration process."
