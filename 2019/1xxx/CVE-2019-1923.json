The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the device configuration interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the configuration interface, which may require a password, and then accessing the device's physical interface and inserting a USB storage device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device in an elevated security context. At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones firmware releases 7.6.2SR5 and prior."
