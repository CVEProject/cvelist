The responsible code is getExtensionIdForOpcode in serialization/sb3.js. The use of _ is incompatible with a protection mechanism in older versions, in which URLs were split and consequently deserialization attacks were prevented. NOTE: the scratch.mit.edu hosted service is not affected because of the lack of worker scripts."
