Users are encouraged to combine this guidance with the general security guidelines for a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy.\n\nTo reduce risk, Rockwell Automation recommends users:\n    Employ proper network segmentation and security controls.\n    Minimize network exposure for all control system devices.\n    Locate control systems behind firewalls.\n    Isolate control systems from other networks when possible.\n    Refer to the Converged Plantwide Ethernet (CPwE) Design and Implementation Guide for best practices deploying network segmentation and broader defense-in-depth strategies.\n    Consider using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, VPN, or other security appliances.\n    Ensure the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to Runtime\u2019s folder location is granted with a minimum amount of rights, as needed.\n\nPlease see publications from Rockwell Automation and Schneider Electric, Xylem, or contact GE for further information about how to mitigate these vulnerabilities in additional affected products."
