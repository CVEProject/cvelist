The following mitigation actions do not ensure complete security but should be considered until the affected time synchronization product is upgraded:\n    Use strong network and physical security protection to prevent an attacker from reaching the local network where Reason RT43X clocks are normally installed. \n    Block TCP/IP Ports 80 and 443 to block the HTTP/HTTPS access to web interface with Reason RT43X products, avoiding all the vulnerabilities. This TCP/IP port blocking should be limited to the Ethernet port interface where the Reason RT43X clock is connected (e.g., using Access Control List (ACL)). Otherwise, other HTTP/HTTPS applications may be affected.\n    Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.\n    Analyze security events to early detect unexpected traffic/communication."
