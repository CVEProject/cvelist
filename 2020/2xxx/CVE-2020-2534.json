Supported versions that are affected are 12.2.1.3.0 and 12.2.1.4.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Reports Developer. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Reports Developer, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Reports Developer accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Reports Developer accessible data.
