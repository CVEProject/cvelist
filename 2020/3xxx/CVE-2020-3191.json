The vulnerability is due to improper length validation of a field in an IPv6 DNS packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS query over IPv6, which traverses the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability is specific to DNS over IPv6 traffic only."
