The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly validate 802.11w disassociation and deauthentication PMFs that it receives. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a spoofed 802.11w PMF from a valid, authenticated client on a network adjacent to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate a single valid user connection to the affected device."
