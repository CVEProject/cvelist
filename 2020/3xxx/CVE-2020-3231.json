The vulnerability exists because broadcast traffic that is received on the 802.1X-enabled port is mishandled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending broadcast traffic on the port before being authenticated. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send and receive broadcast traffic on the 802.1X-enabled port before authentication."
