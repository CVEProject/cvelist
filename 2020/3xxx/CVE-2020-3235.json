The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when the software processes specific SNMP object identifiers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: To exploit this vulnerability by using SNMPv2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability by using SNMPv3, the attacker must know the user credentials for the affected system."
