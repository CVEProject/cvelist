This may cause BFD sessions to flap when a high rate of specific packets are received. Flapping of BFD sessions in turn may impact routing protocols and network stability, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects only the following platforms with Paradise (PE) chipset-based line cards: PTX1000, PTX3000 (NextGen), PTX5000, PTX10008, PTX10016 Series and QFX10002 Series. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R3-S5 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S8 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S8 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S5 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S2 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S2 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S2 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S3, 20.2R3 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2 on PTX Series, QFX10K Series."
