This vulnerability is due to improper validation of parameters that are sent to a CLI command within the restricted shell. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the device and issuing certain CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to identify file directories on the affected device and write arbitrary files to the file system on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be an authenticated shell user."
