The vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary checks for specific data that is provided to the web services interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the affected system, which could disclose data fragments or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."
