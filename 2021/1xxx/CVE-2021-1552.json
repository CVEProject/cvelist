These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device."
