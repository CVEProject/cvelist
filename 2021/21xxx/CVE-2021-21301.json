In Wire for iOS (iPhone and iPad) before version 3.75 there is a vulnerability where the video capture isn't stopped in a scenario where a user first has their camera enabled and then disables it. It's a privacy issue because video is streamed to the call when the user believes it is disabled. It impacts all users in video calls. This is fixed in version 3.75."
