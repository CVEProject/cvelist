Some examples of configurations that will be vulnerable are:     Resolvers using per zone or global forwarding with forward first (forward first is the default).     Resolvers not using global forwarding, but with per-zone forwarding with either forward first (the default) or forward only.     Resolvers configured with global forwarding along with zone statements that disable forwarding for part of the DNS namespace. Authoritative-only BIND 9 servers are not vulnerable to this flaw.
