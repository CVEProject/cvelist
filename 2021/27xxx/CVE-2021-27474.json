For further information about the risks of unprotected Internet accessible control systems, please see Knowledgebase Article PN715\nLocate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.\nWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize a VPN is only as secure as the connected devices."
