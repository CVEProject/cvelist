Note that except for driver\ndomains, guests don't normally have a need to establish grant mappings,\ni.e. they may be okay to run with \"max_maptrack_frames=0\" in their xl\ndomain configurations.\n\n- From Xen 4.14 onwards it is also possible to alter the system wide upper\nbound of the number of grant mappings Xen would allow guests to\nestablish by writing to the /params/gnttab_max_maptrack_frames\nhypervisor file system node.
