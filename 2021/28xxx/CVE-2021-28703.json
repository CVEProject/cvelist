The\nmajority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for\nits entire lifetime.  Grant table v2 status pages, however, get\nde-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1.  The freeing\nof such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest\nthese pages were mapped.  The hypervisor tracks only one use within\nguest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of\nthese pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple\nlocations.  Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then\nretain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other\npurposes.\n\nThis bug was fortuitously fixed by code cleanup in Xen 4.14, and\nbackported to security-supported Xen branches as a prerequisite of the\nfix for XSA-378."
