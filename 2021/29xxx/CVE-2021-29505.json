No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. ### Patches If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.17. ### Workarounds See [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs. ### References See full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-xxxxx](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-xxxxx.html). ### Credits V3geB1rd, white hat hacker from Tencent Security Response Center found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it. ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues) * Email us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)"
