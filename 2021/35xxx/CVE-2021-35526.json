Furthermore, recommended security practices as defined in SDM600 security deployment guideline and firewall configurations can help to protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include that process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.\n\nAdditional recommendation is to follow the hardening guidelines published by \u201cThe Center for Internet Security (CIS)\u201d https://www.cisecurity.org/about-us/ to protect the host Operating System."
