Such practices include ensuring critical applica-tions and systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall.  Firewalls should be configured to have the minimum number of ports exposed and open ports should be justified and docu-mented. Critical systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. It is important to implement robust security awareness training to ensure users are able to identify common attacks or content such as phishing E-Mails or malicious web pages."
