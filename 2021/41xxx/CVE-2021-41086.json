In affected versions users are subject to cross site scripting (XSS) attacks via clipboard content. jsuites is vulnerable to DOM based XSS if the user can be tricked into copying _anything_ from a malicious and pasting it into the html editor. This is because a part of the clipboard content is directly written to `innerHTML` allowing for javascript injection and thus XSS. Users are advised to update to version 4.9.11 to resolve."
