This vulnerability is due to improper authorization checking for HTTP requests that are submitted to the affected web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected instance of AppDynamics Controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the login page for an administrative console. AppDynamics has released software updates that address this vulnerability."
