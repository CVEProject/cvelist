An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted command on the CLI or by submitting a crafted HTTPS request to the web-based management interface of the Cisco ASA that is hosting the ASA FirePOWER module.\r Note: To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative access to the Cisco ASA.
