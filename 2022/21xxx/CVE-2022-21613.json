Supported versions that are affected are 12.2.1.3.0 and 12.2.1.4.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Enterprise Data Quality. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Enterprise Data Quality, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Enterprise Data Quality accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Enterprise Data Quality accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Enterprise Data Quality.
