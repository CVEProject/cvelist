The memory leak causes RTNEXTHOP/route and next-hop memory pressure issue and the KRT queue will eventually get stuck with the error- 'ENOMEM -- Cannot allocate memory'. The out-of-sync state between RIB and FIB can be seen with the \"show route\" and \"show route forwarding-table\" command. This issue will lead to failures for adding new routes.\n\nThe KRT queue status can be checked using the CLI command \"show krt queue\": \n \n  user@host > show krt state \n  High-priority add queue: 1 queued \n                ADD nhtype Router index 0 (31212) \n                    error 'ENOMEM -- Cannot allocate memory' \n                    kqp '0x8ad5e40' \n \nThe following messages will be observed in /var/log/messages, which indicate high memory for routes/nexthops: \n\n  host rpd[16279]: RPD_RT_HWM_NOTICE: New RIB highwatermark for routes: 266 [2022-03-04 05:06:07] \n  host  rpd[16279]: RPD_KRT_Q_RETRIES: nexthop ADD: Cannot allocate memory \n  host rpd[16279]: RPD_KRT_Q_RETRIES: nexthop ADD: Cannot allocate memory \n  host kernel: rts_veto_net_delayed_unref_limit: Route/nexthop memory is severe pressure.
