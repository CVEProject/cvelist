Steps:\n1) Install or upgrade Drive Composer pro version to 2.7.1\n2) In ABB Automation Builder Options, select External tools.\n3) At Drive composer pro-line, select Custom and select the installed Drive Composer pro version 2.7.1 executable typically in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\DriveWare\\Drive Composer pro\\2.7\n\nAlternatively, users are able to remove the vulnerable Drive Composer for ABB Automation Builder. This can be done either from ABB Automation Builder Installation manager or from Windows Settings: Apps & features."
