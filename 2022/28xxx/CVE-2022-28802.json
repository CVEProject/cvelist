In other words, Code by Zapier was providing a customer-controlled general-purpose virtual machine that unintentionally granted full access to all users of a company's account, but was supposed to enforce role-based access control within that company's account. Before 2022-08-17, a customer could have resolved this by (in effect) using a separate virtual machine for an application that held credentials - or other secrets - that weren't supposed to be shared among all of its employees. (Multiple accounts would have been needed to operate these independent virtual machines.)"
