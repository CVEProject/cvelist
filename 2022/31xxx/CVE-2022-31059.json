This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourseâ€™s default Content Security Policy. This issue is patched in version 1.0.1 of the Discourse Calendar plugin. As a workaround, ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks."
