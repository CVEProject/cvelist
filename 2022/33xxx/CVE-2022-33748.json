For the xl toolstack, the vulnerability does not\n   manifest if either:\n\n   1) Every guest has `max_grant_version=1` in their configuration file,\n      or\n\n   2) The global xl.conf has `max_grant_version=1`, and no guests have\n      the default overridden by selecting `max_grant_version=2`.\n\nOnly multiple cooperating guests can exploit the vulnerability."
