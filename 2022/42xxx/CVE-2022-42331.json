CPUs of other architectures\nare not vulnerable.\n\nThe problematic codepath is only reachable on x86 CPUs which follow\nAMD's behaviour with respect to SYSCALL instructions from compatibility\nmode segments.  This means that AMD and Hygon CPUs are potentially\nvulnerable, whereas Intel CPUs are not.  Other vendors have not been\nchecked.\n\nOnly PV guests can leverage the vulnerability.\n\nOn Xen 4.16 and later, the vulnerability is only present if 32bit PV\nguest support is compiled in - i.e. CONFIG_PV32=y.  On Xen 4.15 and\nolder, all supported build configurations are vulnerable.\n\nThe vulnerability is only present when booting on hardware that supports\nSMEP or SMAP (Supervisor Mode Execution/Access Prevention).  This is\nbelieved to be some Family 0x16 models, and all later CPUs."
