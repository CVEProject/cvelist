It didn't keep\nus from continuing to use a buffer that we already had found.\n\nIn this case we're searching the commit root to cache the block group,\nso we can start committing the transaction and switch the commit root\nand then start writing.  After the switch we can look up an extent\nbuffer that hasn't been written yet and start processing that block\ngroup.  Then we fail to write that block out and clear Uptodate on the\npage, and then we start spewing these errors.\n\nNormally we're protected by the tree lock to a certain degree here.  If\nwe read a block we have that block read locked, and we block the writer\nfrom locking the block before we submit it for the write.  However this\nisn't necessarily fool proof because the read could happen before we do\nthe submit_bio and after we locked and unlocked the extent buffer.\n\nAlso in this particular case we have path->skip_locking set, so that\nwon't save us here.  We'll simply get a block that was valid when we\nread it, but became invalid while we were using it.\n\nWhat we really want is to catch the case where we've \"read\" a block but\nit's not marked Uptodate.  On read we ClearPageError(), so if we're\n!Uptodate and !Error we know we didn't do the right thing for reading\nthe page.\n\nFix this by checking !Uptodate && !Error, this way we will not complain\nif our buffer gets invalidated while we're using it, and we'll maintain\nthe spirit of the check which is to make sure we have a fully in-cache\nblock while we're messing with it."
