                "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxsk: Fix race at socket teardown\n\nFix a race in the xsk socket teardown code that can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference splat. The current xsk unbind code in xsk_unbind_dev() starts by\nsetting xs->state to XSK_UNBOUND, sets xs->dev to NULL and then waits for any\nNAPI processing to terminate using synchronize_net(). After that, the release\ncode starts to tear down the socket state and free allocated memory.\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000c0\n  PGD 8000000932469067 P4D 8000000932469067 PUD 0\n  Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n  CPU: 25 PID: 69132 Comm: grpcpp_sync_ser Tainted: G          I       5.16.0+ #2\n  Hardware name: Dell Inc.

First, setting xs->dev to NULL\nbefore waiting for all users to stop using the socket is not correct. The\nentry to the data plane functions xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), and xsk_recvmsg()\nare all guarded by a test that xs->state is in the state XSK_BOUND and if not,\nit returns right away. But one process might have passed this test but still\nhave not gotten to the point in which it uses xs->dev in the code. In this\ninterim, a second process executing xsk_unbind_dev() might have set xs->dev to\nNULL which will lead to a crash for the first process. The solution here is\njust to get rid of this NULL assignment since it is not used anymore. Before\ncommit 42fddcc7c64b (\"xsk: use state member for socket synchronization\"),\nxs->dev was the gatekeeper to admit processes into the data plane functions,\nbut it was replaced with the state variable xs->state in the aforementioned\ncommit.\n\nThe second problem is that synchronize_net() does not wait for any process in\nxsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), or xsk_recvmsg() to complete, which means that the\nstate they rely on might be cleaned up prematurely. This can happen when the\nnotifier gets called (at driver unload for example) as it uses xsk_unbind_dev().\nSolve this by extending the RCU critical region from just the ndo_xsk_wakeup\nto the whole functions mentioned above, so that both the test of xs->state ==\nXSK_BOUND and the last use of any member of xs is covered by the RCU critical\nsection. This will guarantee that when synchronize_net() completes, there will\nbe no processes left executing xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), or xsk_recvmsg() and\nstate can be cleaned up safely. Note that we need to drop the RCU lock for the\nskb xmit path as it uses functions that might sleep. Due to this, we have to\nretest the xs->state after we grab the mutex that protects the skb xmit code\nfrom, among a number of things, an xsk_unbind_dev() being executed from the\nnotifier at the same time."
