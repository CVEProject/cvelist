The panic is of the\nform below and is observed only with following option disabled(profile) for the\nsaid LPAR 'Enable Performance Information Collection' in the HMC:\n\n Kernel attempted to write user page (1c) - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)\n BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference on write at 0x0000001c\n Faulting instruction address: 0xc008000001b90844\n Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]\n<snip>\n NIP [c008000001b90844] drc_pmem_query_stats+0x5c/0x270 [papr_scm]\n LR [c008000001b92794] papr_scm_probe+0x2ac/0x6ec [papr_scm]\n Call Trace:\n       0xc00000000941bca0 (unreliable)\n       papr_scm_probe+0x2ac/0x6ec [papr_scm]\n       platform_probe+0x98/0x150\n       really_probe+0xfc/0x510\n       __driver_probe_device+0x17c/0x230\n<snip>\n ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception\n\nOn investigation looks like this panic was caused due to a 'stat_buffer' of\nsize==0 being provided to drc_pmem_query_stats() to fetch all performance\nstats-ids of an NVDIMM. However drc_pmem_query_stats() shouldn't have been called\nsince the vPMEM NVDIMM doesn't support and performance stat-id's. This was caused\ndue to missing check for 'p->stat_buffer_len' at the beginning of\npapr_scm_pmu_check_events() which indicates that the NVDIMM doesn't support\nperformance-stats.\n\nFix this by introducing the check for 'p->stat_buffer_len' at the beginning of\npapr_scm_pmu_check_events().\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/6B3A522A-6A5F-4CC9-B268-0C63AA6E07D3@linux.ibm.com"
