This vulnerability is due to an implementation error within the cryptographic functions for SSL/TLS traffic processing when they are offloaded to the hardware. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of SSL/TLS traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected error in the hardware-based cryptography engine, which could cause the device to reload."
