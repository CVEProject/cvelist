To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be a member of the admin group.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because user-supplied input is not properly validated when NETCONF is used to upload packages to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted package file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write crafted files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem or delete arbitrary files from the filesystem of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition. \r\n\r Note: By default, during install, Cisco NSO will be set up to run as the root user unless the --run-as-user option is used."
