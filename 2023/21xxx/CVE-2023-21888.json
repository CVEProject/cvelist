Supported versions that are affected are 18.8.0-18.8.15, 19.12.0-19.12.15, 20.12.0-20.12.10 and  21.12.0-21.12.8. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Primavera Gateway.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Primavera Gateway, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Primavera Gateway accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of Primavera Gateway accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.4 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts).  CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)."
