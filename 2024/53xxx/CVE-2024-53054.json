A large number of cpuset cgroups are deleted.\n2. Set cpu on and off repeatly.\n3. Set watchdog_thresh repeatly.\nThe scripts can be obtained at LINK mentioned above the signature.\n\nThe reason for this issue is cgroup_mutex and cpu_hotplug_lock are\nacquired in different tasks, which may lead to deadlock.\nIt can lead to a deadlock through the following steps:\n1. A large number of cpusets are deleted asynchronously, which puts a\n   large number of cgroup_bpf_release works into system_wq. The max_active\n   of system_wq is WQ_DFL_ACTIVE(256). Consequently, all active works are\n   cgroup_bpf_release works, and many cgroup_bpf_release works will be put\n   into inactive queue. As illustrated in the diagram, there are 256 (in\n   the acvtive queue) + n (in the inactive queue) works.\n2. Setting watchdog_thresh will hold cpu_hotplug_lock.read and put\n   smp_call_on_cpu work into system_wq. However step 1 has already filled\n   system_wq, 'sscs.work' is put into inactive queue. 'sscs.work' has\n   to wait until the works that were put into the inacvtive queue earlier\n   have executed (n cgroup_bpf_release), so it will be blocked for a while.\n3. Cpu offline requires cpu_hotplug_lock.write, which is blocked by step 2.\n4. Cpusets that were deleted at step 1 put cgroup_release works into\n   cgroup_destroy_wq. They are competing to get cgroup_mutex all the time.\n   When cgroup_metux is acqured by work at css_killed_work_fn, it will\n   call cpuset_css_offline, which needs to acqure cpu_hotplug_lock.read.\n   However, cpuset_css_offline will be blocked for step 3.\n5. At this moment, there are 256 works in active queue that are\n   cgroup_bpf_release, they are attempting to acquire cgroup_mutex, and as\n   a result, all of them are blocked. Consequently, sscs.work can not be\n   executed. Ultimately, this situation leads to four processes being\n   blocked, forming a deadlock.\n\nsystem_wq(step1)\t\tWatchDog(step2)\t\t\tcpu offline(step3)\tcgroup_destroy_wq(step4)\n...\n2000+ cgroups deleted asyn\n256 actives + n inactives\n\t\t\t\t__lockup_detector_reconfigure\n\t\t\t\tP(cpu_hotplug_lock.read)\n\t\t\t\tput sscs.work into system_wq\n256 + n + 1(sscs.work)\nsscs.work wait to be executed\n\t\t\t\twarting sscs.work finish\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpercpu_down_write\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP(cpu_hotplug_lock.write)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t...blocking...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcss_killed_work_fn\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP(cgroup_mutex)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcpuset_css_offline\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP(cpu_hotplug_lock.read)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t...blocking...\n256 cgroup_bpf_release\nmutex_lock(&cgroup_mutex);\n..blocking...\n\nTo fix the problem, place cgroup_bpf_release works on a dedicated\nworkqueue which can break the loop and solve the problem. System wqs are\nfor misc things which shouldn't create a large number of concurrent work\nitems. If something is going to generate >\n---truncated---"
