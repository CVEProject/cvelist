# CVE Automation Working Group Git Pilot

The [CVE Automation Working
Group](https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group) is
piloting use of git to share information about public vulnerabilities. 
The goal is to learn not only what features are necessary to support
the "plumbing" of sending and receiving the data, but also which
attributes and metadata are needed in the CVE format to support
automation. 

See [How to Contribute](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for details on participating in this pilot.

This repository holds information included in the [CVE
List](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/) formatted using the [CVE JSON
format](https://github.com/CVEProject/automation-working-group/tree/master/cve_json_schema). 

Use of the CVE information in this repository is subject to the [CVE
Terms of Use](https://cve.mitre.org/about/termsofuse.html). 


## Overview of the Repository

Information about each CVE id is stored as a unique file in the repo
in a subdirectory based on the year as well as the numeric portion of
the id, truncated by 1,000.  Thus, [2017/3xxx](2017/3xxx) is for
CVE-2017-3000 - CVE-2017-3999, and [2017/1002xxx](2017/1002xxx) is for
CVE-2017-1002000 - CVE-2017-1002999. 

The CVE Team updates these files automatically every hour using
information from the CVE List, provided there have been changes.  The
synchronization job kicks off at the top of the hour and should
complete within 5 minutes. 

For ids that have been populated, the files contain the description
and references that appear in the [CVE
List](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/).  They may also contain
information about the affected product(s) and problem type(s), which
CNAs have been supplying when making assignments during the past year
but which is not included in the CVE List.  And going forward, it is
hoped that they will contain a richer collection of information about
the vulnerability, as supported by the full CVE JSON schema.
